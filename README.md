# Generalizability of Adversarial Robustness Under Distribution Shifts
This repository contains the PyTorch implementation of the paper "Generalizability of Adversarial Robustness Under Distribution Shifts" published at the Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) journal. The paper investigates the interplay between adversarial robustness and domain generalization, and shows that both empirical and certified robustness generalize to unseen domains, even in a real-world medical application.

## Requirements

The code requires the following packages:

- ...

## Usage

### Empirical Robustness

To train the models and evaluate the generalization of empirical robustness, run the following command:
```
# code will be added soon.
```

### Certified Robustness

To train the models and evaluate the generalization of certified robustness, run the following command:
```
# code will be added soon.
```
